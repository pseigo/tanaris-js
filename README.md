> [!NOTE]
>
> Alpha builds are provided on [GitHub][github-releases] and [npm][npm] for
> early testing.

## History

The name comes from the fictional _Warcraft_ universe's _Tanaris_ region, known
for its _Caverns of Time_, home to a flight of bronze dragons blessed with
temporal magic whose purpose is to safeguard time from those who wish to
rewrite it.
