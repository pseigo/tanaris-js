# Tanaris

A common utility library for client-side JavaScript applications.

> _Tanaris_ is **experimental software**. It is provided "as is", without

>
> There is no near-term plan for API backwards compatibility. Please pin to an

> This library is home to common code for software applications developed by
> its authors. It only includes the _smallest_ set of utilities that its client
> applications have needed, nothing more.
>
> We are **_not_ taking feature requests** at this time, but suggestions for
> improvements (within scope) are welcome and appreciated!
>
> In accordance with the license, you are free to study and derive from the
> source code for your own purposes.
>
> As the library matures and the domains it serves becomes clearer, we may
> someday consider moving _Tanaris_ in a direction towards being a 'standard
> library' of sorts for general use.

## History

The name comes from the fictional _Warcraft_ universe's _Tanaris_ region, known
for its _Caverns of Time_, home to a flight of bronze dragons blessed with
temporal magic whose purpose is to safeguard time from those who wish to
rewrite it â€” an allusion to the nature of writing the same utilities again and
again, and ensuring that work lives on, beyond the lifetimes of the
applications that needed them.
