> There is currently no plan for API backwards compatibility across versions.
> For now the best experience is probably to pin to an exact version/commit

## Upgrade

Simply run `npm install` again with the version you wish to upgrade to.

e.g., `npm install --save-exact tanaris@0.0.1-alpha.1` for that specific alpha
release, or `npm install --save-exact tanaris@alpha` for the latest alpha
release.

## Scope/roadmap

This library is home to common code for software applications developed by its
authors. It only includes the smallest set of utilities that its client
applications have needed, nothing more.

We are **not taking feature requests** at this time, but suggestions for
improvements (within existing scope) and bug reports are welcome and
appreciated!

## History

The name comes from the fictional _Warcraft_ universe's _Tanaris_ region, known
for its _Caverns of Time_, home to a flight of bronze dragons blessed with
temporal magic whose purpose is to safeguard time from those who wish to
rewrite it â€” an allusion to the nature of writing the same utilities again and
again, and ensuring that work lives on, beyond the lifetimes of the
applications that needed them.
